This is a simulation of TV game show based on assembly language. *Embedded systems and real-time system.

## CHALLENGES:

I faced so many problems to create this project by using Assembly language. To create this small project I had to write many lines. If I used C or other languages it will be easier to build. 
*Reduce the run time  
*Fixing Duplication error, unnecessary inputs, etc.
*Changing exe. Color
*Implementation of loop
*Adding sound, emoji, etc.
*Design the starting.
*Closing function properly.

The big challenge of mine was pointing out the problems and came to a solution.
